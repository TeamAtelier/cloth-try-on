# Virtual Shirt Overlay with Pose Detection

This project uses computer vision to overlay virtual shirts on a person detected through a webcam. The project utilizes OpenCV for video capture and image processing, and the cvzone library for pose detection and image overlay. Additionally, users can switch between different virtual shirts using virtual buttons.
